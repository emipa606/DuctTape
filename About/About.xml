==================================================

This is a joke mod. It isn't meant to be balanced, it's just a fun little mod I cooked up thanks to CryoStasis's post on the Rimworld subreddit. https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/bm28o3/i_probably_should_have_found_food_first_at_least/

Duct Tape can be made at a tailoring bench with the Complex Clothing research using 3 cloth and a level 4 crafter. It can be used as a medicine, although its worse than herbal medicine. It counts as fabric, leather, metal, wood, and stone for all crafting and construction purposes. Yes, you can make weapons and armor out of it. Bedrolls, beds, furniture, clothes, walls, doors, if it lets you choose its material, you can make it out of duct tape.

Enjoy!</description>
